public static long staircase(int n) {
		//Your code goes here
        if(n<=1)
            return 1;
        long[] stair = new long[n + 1];
        stair[0] = 1;
        stair[1] = 1;
        stair[2] = 2;
 
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++)
            stair[i] = stair[i - 1] + stair[i - 2] + stair[i - 3];
 
        return stair[n];
