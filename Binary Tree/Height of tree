For a given Binary Tree of integers, find and return the height of the tree.
Example:
                        10
                      /      \
                    20      30
                   /    \
                 40    50

Height of the given tree is 3. 

Height is defined as the total number of nodes along the longest path from the root to any of the leaf node.





public static int height(BinaryTreeNode<Integer> root) {
		//Your code goes here
        if(root==null)
            return 0;
        int left = height(root.left);
        int right = height(root.right);
        
        return 1 + Math.max(left, right);
	}
